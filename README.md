# ConsoleApp_MultiplicationTable_ForKids_CSharp
The Console Application was crafted with the goal of assisting children aged 3-10 in mastering the multiplication table at their own comfortable pace. It provides a platform for them to reinforce their understanding through interactive learning sessions and test their knowledge afterward.
The application is structured into four main folders, each serving a specific purpose: Data, Model, Logic, and Input Validation.

The Data folder operates as a local database, storing user inputs.
The Model folder encompasses the architectural components of the application.
The Logic folder hosts diverse functionalities crucial for the application's functionality.
The Input Validation folder ensures the validation of each user input.
